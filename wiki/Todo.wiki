#summary Stuff that needs to be done. Pretty chaotic.

This list things that need to be done on Tweener.

Most stuff like bugs and decisions should be listed on the "issues" tab instead of here. This is just a basic list before it gets moved to a more serious issue. Some of this stuff has even been done already.

==Bugs==


===Other small random bugs===
 * fix/check onOverwrite... it indeed should have the property name as a parameter?
 * TweenListObj.clone() must duplicate auxiliary functions
 * compiling under the Flash 9 IDE with strict mode on, pauseTweens/resumeTweens can't be called with more than 1 parameter... test on the SDK compiler -> probably will change as the AS3 compiler on flash9 has been replaced by the SDK compiler
 * stuff that MIGHT have been fixed by 1.18.27, has to be tested
   * tScope disappearing after an onComplete.apply?
   * looks like skipUpdates isn't working very well when using special properties - for example, blurX/blurY updater for Miller MGD. Gotta test. -> might also have been fixed on 1.24.45?
   * sometimes onComplete gets called twice???! attempts to delete it cause strange behavior. --> apparently the duplication happens when there are several tweenings on the same object
   * calling a Tweener.addTween on a function that's called by a Tweener.addTween onComplete parameter is not working? for example, Miller MGD's showMaoR


==Features===

===Debug level===

Add a debugLevel/setDebugLevel/etc for debugging purposes... As in
 # LOG ERRORS: trace try..catch data2
 # LOG WARNINGS: trace non-fatal warnings, such as the transition time normalization
 # LOG INFORMATION: trace stuff like all updates/adds/completion


===Other small random features===

 * bezier with multiple points; bezier with 3 dimensions
 * setDefault() method to set the default value for some properties - time, transition, delay, rounded, ...
 * "minimumFPS" or "enforceFPS", to use the enforced FPS some AS3 engines (like Flex's Tween one) uses?
 * speed optimizations when adding abd updating tweenings - test with heavy.fla. must also benchmark additions on existing tweenings, and removal time
 * allow arrays as the transition parameter so it can use multi-equation transitions
 * onUpdate must be fired even if there's no property being tweened
 * some way to use parameters on special properties.. so the bezier slide (et al) can be done.
 * debug_setModifierKey() so timeScale can easily be changed when debugging (ie, SHIFT activates fast-forward)?
 * properly support .useFrames!
 * when restarting the movie twice in a roll with ctrl+enter from the flash IDE, problems arise because flash doesn't reset class variables. existing tweenings carry? check a better way of using `_`engineExists...
 * make a proper addCaller (fix the existing one) - suggested by Paulo Afonso
 * addCaller doesn't work with several movieclips. calledTimes should be independent from scope... or call them all at the same time?
 * add endTween, skipTween (scrub?).. as suggested by Ephraim Tabackman
 * add onPause()
 * add onResume()
 * add onRemove()


===Decisions, decisions===

 * add .scopes back, but making it some kind of special multi-tween in which variables are tied together?
 * TODO: make on`*`() events also respond to instances... use addListener?


==Documentation==

 * Properly mention in custom functions: http://timotheegroleau.com/Flash/experiments/easing_function_generator.htm


==Special properties==

===Done===

 * `_`color: integer tint, turns into `_`color`_*`
 * `_`colorTransform: colortransform object, uses the `_`color`_*` equivalent

 * `_`color`_`ra ...rb ...ga ...gb ...ba ...bb ...aa ...ab
 * `_`frame
 * `_`sound`_`pan
 * `_`sound`_`volume

===To do===

 * textfield
   * color
   * scroll
   * leading
   * letterspacing
   * fontsize

 * filters... and other 'special' properties that need 'touch' like scrollrect, colortransform, etc
 * add a new "special properties" class for separate color transformation properties - ie, `_`brightness, `_`hue, stuff like that


==A lot of random stuff with no proper wiki format==

As suggested by Nate Chatellier:

 * equations (and others?) should have default values for optional parameters
 * glued movieclip creation.... check `_`root references
